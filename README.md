# Netflix-Shows-Data-Analysis
### Synopsis

In this analysis, I will explore the distribution and information pertaining to Netflix TV shows and Movies. This stems out of personal interest of mine, which began when i asked myself how many shows Netflix only produces a single season for. I found this dataset and began exploring. The answer to that question is many. Many Netflix shows are only produced for a single season

**Insight:** People likely spend more time on Netflix watching tv shows rather than movies, so Netflix produces more TV shows. TV shows also tend to have lower budgets per hour of screentime so it might more sense financially as well. In the end, Netflix's goal is to maintain high engagement, so this isn't surprising. 

### Distribution of Ratings by Age Groups

**Insight:** Nothing shocking here, all paying subscribers are adults so they cater to their customer base. Teens likely have less disposable income but Netflix is nevertheless popular among them, so they come in second place. 

### Distribution by Production Country

**Insight:** The largest two contenders after the US seem to be India and the U.K. Egypt appears to be the only large producer in the Middle East, which aligns with my personal knowledge of the Arabic Language film industry. 

### Year Released vs. Year Added

**Insight:** Naturally, shows that arrive to Netflix usually spend some time on other VOD platforms beforehand. 

### Distribution of Show by Season

**Insight:** Confirms my worst nightmare. There are too many good shows that don't last longer than a single season. 

### Distribution of Movies by Screentime

**Insight:** Again, nothing shocking. Most movies fall between 1 hour 30 minutes and 2 hours 30 minutes

### Top Genres Released by Year

**Insight:** The top two most popular genres year over year are comedies and dramas. If you want to produce a Netflix worthy show, make sure it is one of these genres
